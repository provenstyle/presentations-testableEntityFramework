#A Testable Approach to Entity Framework

Entity Framework makes it super easy to write data access code, but it can be a real challenge to write code that is testable and maintainable.  We are going to look at the Repository, Unit of Work, Query Object, and Inversion of Control patterns and how we can use them to write code that is testable not only at the business layer, but also at the data layer.  We will be using a wonderful little framework called Highway Data to do most of the heavy lifting.
